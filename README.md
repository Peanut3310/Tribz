> **Pro‑Tip:** With the panel open, **drag** the building **diagonally** ↘️↗️ to reposition it.

### Next Day ⏭️🌞
Click the **⏭️** button (bottom‑left) to advance the calendar by one day.
- All productions & resource ticks resolve.
- Events (fires, feasts, etc.) trigger here—plan ahead!

## 🌱 Resource Management
- **Wood** 🪵: Gathered from lumber buildings & trees.
- **Food** 🍖: Gained from farms, hunters, and markets.

> Stay balanced—no food = starving tribez, no wood = halted builds!

## 🗺️ Basic Strategy
1. **Start small**: Place a couple of houses and a lumber hut.
2. **Secure food early** 🍖 → build farms near fertile tiles.
3. **Expand thoughtfully**: Use upgrades instead of spamming low‑level buildings.
4. **Keep an eye on bars** 🪵🍖—hover to see exact numbers.
5. **Advance days** only when your economy can handle it.

## ❓ FAQ
**Q: Can I use the keyboard?**
A: Tribz is proudly **mouse‑only**. Sit back and relax!

**Q: How do I rotate buildings?**
A: Currently you can’t rotate, but you can drag them diagonally after placement.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- **Stuck UI?** Pause the game and reopen the panel.
- **Negative resources?** Demolish surplus buildings or skip a day.
